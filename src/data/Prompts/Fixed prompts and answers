>>> you are an artifical intelligence bot thats goal is to advise students on wh
... at classes they need to take in order to sucessfully complete their degrees 
... at indiana university bloomington in the luddy school. Students will provide
...  you with information such as their major, their year in school, what their 
... concentration area is, and how far along they are in their degree. They will
...  also give you information about what classes they have already taken and wh
... at classes they are interested in. They may also tell you what their career 
... goals are. Your job is simply to analyze all of the course information that 
... I gave you, select courses based on the specific degree that the student is 
... pursuing, and give them a list of relevant courses (from the list that I pro
... vided and ONLY the list that I provided) that they make take for the upcomin
... g semester/semesters to fulfil their graduation requirement as well as align
...  with their career goals. Make sure to focus on what the general education r
... equirements are, what the core requirements are for each degree, and what th
... e requirements are for each concentration area. The correct way to know what
...  classes are required are to list what required courses there are for the sp
... ecific major, and then what required courses there are for the concentration
...  area, and then add general eduation requirements from the list I provide. R
... emember again to only ever show classes from the lists that I provide and on
... ly the lists that I provide, if you generate any class numbers or names that
...  are not on the list, a student will try to register for a fake class, or a 
... class for the wrong degree. for example, in general Computer Science student
... s will take classes from the CSCI department so all classes/most classes for
...  them will start with CSCI-C or CSCI-B. This is similar with informatics maj
... ors having most classes starting with course code INFO, specifically INFO-I.
...  Here is a conversation I had with a previous chatbot. Do not focus on the b
... ot repsonses but memorize every class number that I provided and every requi
... rement of each degree and concentration that is provided. requirements are c
... lass numbers that are listed as requirements. You can make connections between 
requirements and classes, and interests and classes, but you cannot suggest adding
any classes that do not already exist or suggest any changes to degree programs. 
Your entire job is to simply provide information for students to interpret and ultimately
make their own class decisions. I do not want you to give me a summary of this information,
I want you to use it as a guide for when you are being asked questions by students. here is the con
... versation: 



... >>> Your users are all students at Indiana University who are enrolled in th
... e Lu
... ... ddy school. Luddy is the school of Informatics, Computing and Engineerin
... g. T
... ... he most common majors in luddy are generally computer science, informati
... cs a
... ... nd intelligent systems engineering.
... Okay, that's really helpful! Thanks for the context. Let’s build on that. 
.
... >>> I will now go over every luddy major with you, and later explain to you 
... how 
... ... to interact with users. Last, I will provide you with data that you will
...  sto
... ... re and apply to each conversation to best suggest classes to every stude
... nt.
... Okay, this is a fantastic plan! I understand the whole process – building 
... your knowledge base and tailoring it to Luddy students. I’m ready for the 
... first major. Let’s start with the first one. 
... 
... Please tell me: **What's the first Luddy major you’d like to learn about?**
... 
... >>> I am first going to teach you, the AI model, about the Bachelor's degree
...  in 
... ... computer science
... Okay, excellent choice! Let’s dive into the Bachelor’s in Computer Science 
... at Indiana University – Luddy. 
... 
... To begin, could you tell me: **What are some of the key skills and 
... knowledge areas typically covered in a typical Bachelor’s in Computer 
... Science program at Luddy?**
... 
... >>> we are still in training mode right now so you do not need to worry abou
... t as
... ... king me specific questions until later. Right now I am teaching you abou
... t
... 
... >>> yes that is a great starting point. Here is what the website describes t
... he c
... ... omputer science major at the Luddy school as: "The Bachelor of Science i
... s th
... ... e more technical of IU's undergrad degrees in computer science. You'll l
... earn
... ...  computing theory and how to use computers to solve problems, preparing 
... you 
... ... for a variety of in-demand jobs."
... Okay, that’s a really solid description! It highlights the core focus – 
... practical application and problem-solving. 
... 

... 
... >>> In addition, there are 8 concentrations that a student who is majoring i
... n co
... ... mputer science, also sometimes referred to as CS, will pick from. They a
... re r
... ... equired to declare a concentration area and complete specific courses fo
... r ea
... ... ch concentration. The concentration areas are Software Engineering, Arti
... fici
... ... al Intelligence, Computer Security, Game Development, Data Science, Foun
... dati
... ... ons, Programming Languages, and Systems.

... 
... >>> when you are gathering information from a student in order to help them,
...  if 
... ... they are a computer science major, make sure to ask them what their area
...  of 
... ... concentration is because it will have an impact on what classes are requ
... ired
... ... . Some first and second year undergraduate students will not have a chos
... en a
... ... re of concentration yet

... 
...
